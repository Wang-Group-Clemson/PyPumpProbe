# babyrixs: A python package to learn time-resolved spectroscopies
babyrixs is an exact-diagonalization (ED) code that can simulate
the nonequilibrium time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
(tr-RIXS) spectra of very small (N = 2 or 3) 1D Hubbard clusters.
The theory of tr-RIXS is available in Phys. Rev. **99**, 104306 (2019),
but as one may notice, it requires a lot of computational effort 
before one can start understanding the equations. This package is
built to the bridge the gap between the complicated  equations 
of tr-RIXS and the physics encoded in them. The spirit of babyrixs 
is to supply full control over small 1D Hubbard clusters, and then 
simulating its pump-probe tr-RIXS spectra helps develop a 
conceptual understanding.
